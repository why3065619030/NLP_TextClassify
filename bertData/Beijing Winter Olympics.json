They have the human capacity and also well thought out plans for whatever infrastructure they built for it. Instead of treating the infrastructure as \"only for the Olympics\" they would have definitely thought about what it will become after the Olympics, especially transport infrastructure. All the 2008 Beijing Olympics structures built are well kept and and in use till this day for example the birds nest. So I don't think its really fair to compare everyone the same way. Olympics has always been expensive, therefore well thought out planning is needed for every country if they want to host it.",

In fact, there were more than 900 dishes (70% are western foods and 30% are Chinese foods) with a 24-hour supply in 2008 Beijing Olympics. The dishes repeated every 8 days, and there is a track system that tracked the ingredients' orgins for up to two years to ensure their safety and taste. You should know that China always greets foreign guests with the highest standards and the Chinese people really take meal seriously, though it's hard for you guys to find out the truth that covered by the western media.",
