"Imaging how much dedications and efforts those players have to put to reserve a seat in Olympic competition, very very very few people can achieve this. I am so jealous. Well done. Enjoy the game! You are the winners already.",2022-03-02
Hope you can show us more from your time there in Beijing. Would love to know your activities and your experience there. Good luck hope you do well in the Games.,2022-03-02

"Wow! so well picked pictures! well picked video! all focus on fences and cages! haha, I can be a reporter too. You have your right to live with the virus, why others don't have the right to choose not to live with the virus. It's cultural differences. you don't need to demonise others when they don't want to do the same thing as yours.",2022-03-02
Beijing winter Olympic Games - Go! Go! Go!,2022-03-02
It always amazes me how y'all turn the positive facts into negative narrations,2022-03-02
Looking forward to see the Beijing Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.,2022-03-02
The world's biggest sporting event is suppose to unite people and bringing the world closer. ,2022-03-02
"I've seen different stories from here, as well as a lot of video clips shared by other athletes themselves, who are enjoying themselves in Beijing right now.  A balance needs to be found to protect local residents and international athletes from virus. Robotic restaurants and self-driving cars are coming as solutions.",2022-03-02
"This journalist is not only got a blind eye, but also got blind heart.",2022-03-02
"You like it, you don't like it, I am sure 99.9% of the participating athletes will be enjoying the game.......",2022-03-02
"Despite fake news and hate from the west, China remains focused on hosting a successful Winter Olympics. It seems unstoppable. That's an attitude that I admire to be honest.",2022-03-02
Can't wait for ice hockey ,2022-03-02
What I can see is well organized national event. They tried their best to serve the athletes and make sure to minimize the virus spread. No other countries can control the virus better than China. Love to see western media use every possible way to turn all these positive things into negative narrations.,2022-03-02
I am okay with different opinions.   But WP's criticism as such with clearly from a biased standpoint is really disgusting......,2022-03-02
it is interesting to see how WP spread sad mood through this “interview”,2022-03-02
"When I see ""Washington Post"" I pretty much sure what's in it.",2022-03-02
"I live in China. I was hoping for something actually about the athletes. We already know it's in a bubble, it's not news. I'm sure China will pull off a masterful job of hosting, but no one is talking about the competition and the athletes.",2022-03-02
WP literally made a lot of efforts in selecting the pictures but not in good journalism,2022-03-02
"Human being need peace no wars, this is the why we need olympics",2022-03-02
I am excited to watch all games in Beijing Olympic! Thank you Beijing for wonderful preparing and present such wonderful game to the world! That is spirit of Olympic!,2022-03-02
You guys forgot to mention that participants are allowed to go and spectate other events since they are in a bubble and they set up a high speed rail network for them to travel around the venues.  This was something that wasn’t even available in the Tokyo games but yours Deliberately left that out and try to make it sound like it’s a controlled game. Trying to demonise china once again.,2022-03-02
"The weather is very dry in the Beijing area and there is snowfall but not much, this  includes the mountains where the olympics are being held. So it is not a matter of occasional using snow machines, but needing vast amounts of snow making. ",2022-01-31
"They looked at 16 previous games, they found environmental, social, and economic sustainability generally trended downwards over time.",2022-01-31
It's more a sign than there is already a disaster happening in the environment worldwide.,2022-01-31
I'm old enough to remember when we used to have real snow.,2022-03-02
"Chose places that already have most of the facilities available (then that excludes poorer countries that could do with more infrastructure). Even then, there are eplenty of abandoned sites. It was great competing at Sydney Olympic Park's athletics track and aquatic centre after the games, plus most of the facilities are still in use!",2022-01-31
"In North America, winter resorts always generate tons if snow every year. Every country that hosted winter Olympics also generated snow. They are collectively doing something to environment if that is the case. I still think it does not have much adverse affect on the environment.",2022-01-31
"as IOC website said, ""All venues will be powered by renewable energy for the first time at the Olympic Games."" in Beijing 2022",2022-03-02
Questions to ask: How does the winter look like in this region in the year before 2015 (the time Beijing was picked to host the game). were they always this dry and no snow as well?,2022-01-31
They should pick one or two countries that they’ve already built in and use that for where they host the Olympics so that they don’t have to keep building. They’ve already done enough damage as is,2022-01-31
The next World Cup would be in Quatar where there would be an air-condition in the stadium!,2022-01-31
"Same thing happened during the Vancouver Olympics. We literally had to truck in new snow. However I don't remember anyone ever calling it a ""disaster for the environment"".",2022-01-31
A Winter Olympic cannot be called Winter Olympic without Winter.,2022-03-02
Interesting why you say this about China and you don’t say it about thousands of other ski hills around the world that do the same.,2022-01-31
gotta say that is pretty amazing feat,2022-03-02
"This comforts me because it shows China doesn't have access to weather machines as they would have used it to make it snow so their winter olympics would be ""the best ever"".",2022-01-31
"We've been doing this at ski resorts worldwide... Never did we not, because of the environment",2022-01-31
"I don't care about the Olympics, since the viewing rights are not freely available in my country, but rather tied up in expensive exclusive license agreements.",2022-01-31
This situation has happened in traditional skiing countries many times in last 50 years.,2022-01-31
Using snow making machines is common in ski resorts... but not on this scale. It's on a nature reserve and this area rarely receives snow. Compare this to games held in Utah... they actually receive real snow in the winter.,2022-01-31
This is BSB reporter. I'm here inside the Beijing Olympics Village. This is the village where American athletes will be staying.  I am here with the Manager of the Village Planner Officer.,2022-03-02

Spectacular opening ceremony!  We have a Uyghur girl to light the Olympic torch in the ceremony!  Advanced technologies are everywhere in the game.  China demonstrates great hospitality to all guests.  Enjoy the wonderful games! ,2022-03-02
"politicizing sports or cultural events would probably delivery the strongest opposition front that some countries would hate to see, but it is happening.",2022-03-02
"Ridiculously funny reports like this just kept going on and on, one after another, and no rest. I'm so sad to see this happening.",2022-03-02
"Wow. you guys are genius, can turn everything into politics, please tell us something how native Indians were genocided from America.",2022-03-02
It's great opening ceremony!,2022-03-02
"Whoever built china olympic 2022 opening cermony, they're so creative",2022-03-02
Extraordinary and meaningful opening,2022-03-02
"It's beautiful and the host country should be very proud. It's sad that people in this country and the west still have the audacity to throw accusations about how the host country manages their own affairs with a complete disregard of what happened in this country and the world (the death from the pandemic, crimes & violence plus guns, racial bias, poverty & homelessness , and the millions of Muslim killed  or forced to be refugees in Iraq, Afghanistan and the mid east caused by these pathetic wars).",2022-03-02
"The boycott countries sent the most athletes to China. Out of 272 western reports on Beijing game.212 is related to human rights concern. Media manipulation is a series of related techniques in which partisans create an image or argument that favours their particular interests. Such tactics may include the use of logical fallacies, manipulation, outright deception(disinformation), rhetorical and propaganda techniques, and often involve the suppression of information or points of view by crowding them out, by inducing other people or groups of people to stop listening to certain arguments, or by simply diverting attention elsewhere.",2022-03-02
The US and west can get so low so as to politicise even a global friendly event like olympics..,2022-03-02
Why I can’t seem to find the full version of the opening ceremony?  I just want to watch the creativities and the arts/designs used in this ceremony,2022-03-02

"YouTube can not watch Olympic Live, America is afraid of China ！ Hahaha",2022-03-02
"The world is not made up of a few countries who want to politicise the games. They just show their small minds, including the presenters of this program.",2022-03-02
"The logic is weird. Do a normal person feel justified to checkout their neighborhood’s bedroom when they don’t want to show?  And when the neighbors want to show friendly,  they chooses not to see and think that’s fake?  Well,  even if I had a suspicious neighbor,  I would keep my mouth shut, pretend people are just friendly and let the authorities to do their work.",2022-03-02
This is going to be one of the most hi-tech Olympic in history.,2022-01-31

"The robot restaurant in the Winter Olympic Village has attracted many foreign athletes. In fact, robot restaurants have been popular in Chinese cities for several years.",2022-03-02
So calm n and unassuming.. They took responsibility to host n spends huge efforts for the safety of the athletes and their own people.,2022-01-31

"I think they're doing a great job, can't imagine if athletes get covid since they're all living in the village, and they couldn't participate in their games, that'll be so terrible, olympics is only happening once in four years and they had gone through many evaluations to be qualify.",2022-03-02

Chinese brands and the digital yuan gain massive international publicity during the winter Olympics.  Repressive political boycott action is making most global brands unhappy as they accelerate loss of international market share. ,2022-03-02
They say all kinds of wonder values but when push comes to shove they don't want to offend China....As the old adage goes...talk is cheap.,2022-03-02

China has come along, I am so happy for China & as a Chinese regardless of where you are, we are all Descendents of Dragons.  Long Live China.................................",2019-12-28

"London had a tough act to follow. The ""human tower"" performance was incredible. So much went into this ceremony. The Chinese raised the bar to another level with their opening and closing ceremonies. I think Great Britain did an incredible performance with theirs. Now, I wonder how Beijing will top this when they host the 2022 Winter Olympics.",2021-12-27
i become so emotional to see so many athletes can have fun and smile without masks. Wish the world can get well soon,2021-12-27

"Beijing Olympic 2008 opening and closing ceremonies remain the best I've seen!  And those were the better days - less hostility among nations.   How I wish our world could cooperate more, and we human kind need it more than ever now as we have the most pressing common problem to tackle with together - the climate change.",2021-12-27
"When Beijing hosted the Olympic, I was in Australia for a summer program right before starting high school. We, a bunch of Chinese students, lived with Australian local families at that time. ",2019-12-28

"Finally! I get to watch the opening ceremony. Thank you! I always miss these ceremonies every Olympics because of the time zone.  What a great use of technology, imagination and just people involved to make a really great ceremony culminate. I would love to have been in the stadium to take it all in!

"If you can understand madarian you will amaze even more on what Lang Ping's coaching... Probably due to her own player experience, she did not fuzz or blame the players at all at any time.  instead, she always gave a very specific instructions (e.g., which opponent player had what habit or what was the next attack she preferred her team to do).  She picked and trained every player by herself so her players were so confident with her.   Absolutely the best volleyball coach in decades!!!",2020-12-27
"As a person learning mandarin (5th year learning it), Lang Ping's coaching is pretty amazing. She doesn't blame them for possible mistakes they made, juts gives them instructions and coaching to make them even better. I love her!!",2021-12-27
"Lan Ping is simply amazing as a coach. She knew how to deal with these young ladies, plus the fact that she's really wise and strategic. So deserved!",2020-12-27
"Looking back here, Zhu shows no fear. I think it is because she's really young at this time so her condition was fresh and eager to contibute just like the opponent's Boskovic. The difference is that Zhu was more stable and controls her error (almost no error).",2021-12-27
Lang Ping just announced her retirement as a coach after Tokyo Olympics. What an overwhelming experience as a player and a coach truly one of the best in the world!,2020-12-27
It's so sad to see that the commentator is like that... I mean come on! As a person from Serbia I too did want Serbia to win but bro! I didn't say anything bad to the other team. I even cheered for them too! ,2021-12-27
I love Serbian team and especially Tijana Bošković. This was a great match and Chinese team really deserved it. Respect both teams. ,2020-12-27
I love Lang Ping she is so calm and she is just sitting back a watching. Shes trained her girls so much that she trusts them and knows that they will come through with a win. And with Serbia's coach is walking around probably trying not to lose his temper.,2020-12-27
I just couldn't pull back smiling and laughing whenever I hear Yuan of China screams out loud in and off court. I love her energy!! Btw she's incredible too.,2020-12-27

"In my younger days, I never had an eye on the volleyball game not until I accidentally watched China women volleyball match first with Brazil, Nevertheland and finally with Serbia for Olympic Championship in Reo. I enjoyed not because of China’s winning, the team work and attitude. There is a strong determination to reach the goal quietly. The games made me a fan of  China Women Volleyball. I am proud of them.",2020-12-27

Thanks a lot for uploading an HD version of the match. Fantastic performance for both teams.,2020-12-27
Favourite moment from each team:,2020-12-27
"For those of you that saying Boskovic is better, look at how many unforced errors she made in this match! Zhu is so consistent and strong, very rarely makes errors, which is why she deserves to be the top paid volleyball player ever!",2020-12-27
"I've been watching this match for couple of times and still feel the passions and excitement. Today I just notice #6 GONG, the youngest player, was substituted-in in set #3 and #4 for the last minutes, she even did not touched the ball once and got the gold medal. Wow! And in the previous match with the Netherlands, she was also substituted by the end of the match, she spiked and got the second last point that time. CHU, Boskovic,.......can't wait to see you in Tokyo Olympics.",2021-12-27
"I always enjoyed watching volleyball before the rio games in more of a hey, volleyball, cool sort of way, but the Serbian team made me go out of my way to watch it. What an enjoyable team to watch in victory or defeat. Love them.",2020-12-27
"Zhu fez o jogo da vida na recepção e Malesevic no ataque. Esta última fez uma boa partida no ataque, até por ser ponteira de preparação, já que sua função no time era passar, defender, dar volume de jogo, e principalmente cobrir a Mihajlovic que, por sua vez, não acordou para o jogo, infelizmente.",2020-12-27

"Depois de 11 anos, esta ainda é  a seleção mais perfeita de todos os tempos. Se tivessem continuado juntas, ganhariam a Rio 2016 e Tóquio 2020.",2020-12-27
Esta foi a melhor selecao feminina brasileira de todos os tempos que vi jogar. Obs. Tenho 69 anos.,2019-12-28

Nessas olimpíadas a Fabiana simplesmente humilhou todas as outras centrais do mundo. Fantástica,2019-12-28
"Grande brasil 🇧🇷 ,siempre sacando la cara por Sudamérica !! Saludos desde chile 🇨🇱",2020-12-27
"A Mari merecia muito ser bicampeã olímpica com a equipe em 2012, mas independente de qualquer coisa ela fez história no esporte brasileiro. Mari Steinbrecher. ",2022-01-31
"The year where Brazil has the most complete all-around team. The golden triangle wing spikers - Mari, Paula, Sheilla - were just too much to any team that time. Fabiana & Walewska were playing super quick and so amazing in both attacks and defense. The legendary Fabi guard the floor almost flawlessly. And of course, the living legend Fofao - the golden hands.",2019-12-28

Só quem é brasileiro e gosta de vôlei sabe o quanto essa medalha de Ouro significou.,2020-12-27
"Fofao y Walewska fueron parte de juegos olímpicos anteriores, de generaciones espectaculares. Me encantó que en esta medalla de oro estuvieran ellas como representantes de anteriores históricas para el Volei brasileño.",2021-12-27
"Bravo Brasil . Que victoria, para recordar por siempre. Felicidades.",2021-12-27
"Não tem como não chorar, vem a lembrança de Atenas quando perdemos a semi final para Rússia e perdermos o 3 lugar para Cuba. Em Pequim 2008 Brasil jogou muito, 8 jogos, 25 sets, 24 ganhos e apenas perdendo 1 set. Sem sombra de dúvidas uns das melhores seleções Olímpicas de Vôlei de todos os tempos.",2019-12-28
"Me deu vontade de rever essa conquista. 14 anos depois, muito vivo em minha memória.",2022-05-01

"Although her qualification performance was a lot better and less wobbly, she still delivered a great routine here. Deserved gold medal! Please upload Tang Xijing's silver beam routine as well. That one is my personal favorite",2021-12-27
"Wonderful sportsmanship in Tokyo 2020! We can see Suni and Simone cheering her on and being happy after her routine. What a well-deserved win, congratulations! And kudos also to the lovely commentators.",2021-12-27
She's so adorable. An incredible gymnast indeed. Totally deserve the gold. Her routine is perfect,2021-12-27

"How adorable of her not even realizing she just won Gold! Love her teammate cheering her on and also love love Jeff, Cecile, Suni, and Simone very excitedly cheering for her too while she was on beam! It’s really heartwarming to watch all the gymnasts were cheering for each other at this Olympics.",2021-12-27
"As someone who has followed Gymnastics so closely since the 80s the one thing that’s gotten better about the sport is the camaraderie. In the 80s/90s the gymnasts didn’t know each other except reputation and name, sometimes not even that, but social media has changed all that. All the gymnasts follow each other on Twitter, Instagram etc so they become friends and supporters even outside the arena… so they’re closer when they do come to the meet.",2021-12-27
"Chinese are among the finest beam workers, I’m so happy for her ",2021-12-27
"It feels great to see other gymnasts applauding her great skills in the background (suni Lee, Tang xijjng), excellence should always be appreciated be it your opponent or your fellow countrymen.",2021-12-27

"This was a fabulous routine, so beautifully performed even with a few wavers. Hopefully she’ll come back to try and defend!",2022-09-28
That was probably the best and most complicated beam routine I've ever seen. I don't know how they don't miss that skinny little beam and crack their heads open. Amazing!,2021-12-27
"Fantastic, can't wait to see her in future competitions, specially Paris 2024, I hope she wins more golds!",2021-12-27

the Paralympic athletes are super heroes and are true inspirations for people all over the world. they all deserve gold medals for their hard work and dedication and for not letting the differences get the best of them. I send them all my love and praise.,2013-12-29
"I've got to be honest. My favorite part was the Paralympic Oath. I think all athletes regardless of their affiliation or sovereignty should take this or a similar oath at BOTH the Olympic and the Paralympic Games. This is my first Paralympic opening, and I respected and was in awe of that part more than any other part of the ceremony. ",2013-12-29

"Umbrellas and apples are very much part of everyday life in Britain, but the ordinary became extraordinary in the Paralympic Games' ambitious and unexpectedly scientific Opening Ceremony. Themes of discovery, adventure, human endeavour and equality are so much more upbeat than the Scouring of the Shire and a painful Hey Jude. Marvellous!",2012-12-29
I get the goosebumps when I hear the beautiful Paralympic Anthem.,2021-12-27
"This is a different opening sequence than the official broadcast. The TV showed a video about the 7/7 bombings & the stadium had a video about 4 of the performers and their journeys. The moment when Lance corporal Rawlins said, ""If you want to know what I will be doing during the ceremony, look up!"" was truly stunning. He was flying the Aerobility plane. The crowd roared! I was standing in the middle of the stadium at this point and was an inspiring moment when he flew over!  Thanks for posting!",2012-12-29
I was thinking about Ian Dury earlier and wishing he was alive to play here... as the Olympics had a music theme. I can hardly believe they actually did it at about 3:26:00 AWESOME!!!!,2012-12-29

"Thats what I mean. The olympics opening ceremony was clearly done on a bigger budget, however this one actually told a story and brought out real emotions. It was hard not to have a lump in ya throat while watching this. It showed that you don't need to go all out there with money, fireworks and so on, you just need a good form of story telling and put real heart into it.",2012-12-29
"The Directors want to so proud of themselves, They put on a magnificent show, Personally much more touching and better than Boyle's Ceremony.",2012-12-29
The national anthem was absolutely beautiful. <3,2012-12-29
The fact they actually came through and built all of this infrastructure and villages in time boogles my mind.,2022-03-02
I pray that they actually use the villages after the games. There are so many Olympic villages that just sit and rot for no good reason.,2022-03-02
"Business Insider is like ""can you believe it, these games aren't going to make a profit. I can't believe it""",2022-03-02
Public infrastructure isn’t supposed to generate profits.,2022-03-02
There are tons of videos right here on Youtube about WHY Olympics are so expensive and a lot of it has nothing to do with the host nation. The standards set by the Olympic committee are sometimes absurd. Beijing is no difference in this regard.,2022-03-02
"Beijing is a large city with a population of 21 million. It is of great commercial value to build a professional ski resort in the surrounding area. There are originally many commercial ski resorts around Beijing, but I think having a more professional and larger ski resort is what most Chinese people would like to see. I live in Tianjin, a city very close to Beijing (30 minutes by high-speed train). I personally would love to go skiing at this ski resort on weekends.",2022-03-02
"Throughline did an amazing podcast on the costs of the Olympic Games. Worth a listen. It’s not just China, the Olympic committee is just trying to greenwash it imo due to all of the recent scrutiny",2022-03-02
"For China, hosting the Olympics is like a car company racing cars — testing your latest technology and then applying it to other models",2022-03-02
"The stock market is still a fantastic tool for building wealth, however, so it's wise to consider investing even if you don't have much money to spare",2022-06-30
"Yep, China did build one line for the vunue commute, but it is not a fresh investment from ground zero. They just added one branch line to the massive domestic 40,000 km high speed railway network.",2022-03-02
"I think the one who was responsible for producing such a  “brilliant” analysis might have forgotten about the infrastructures that would be transcend the sport and would be used way long after the games ended by locals. And I’m pretty sure, if Beijing didn’t live up to it’s promise and underspent and therefore would build poor infrastructure, it definitely would trigger Business Insiders to produce another “show” probably called “Beijing’s cheap olympics” ",2022-11-27
The big air is a permanent structure that was built for the world championship in 2019.,2022-03-02
"The budget for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games is US $1.56 billion, with 6% government subsidy. Most of the venues use the venues of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Infrastructure such as railways will be built even without the Olympic Games, which cannot be counted as the cost of the Olympic Games.",2022-03-02
"Beijing's 2021 gdp is 633 million US dollars. In 2021, the number of subways opened in Beijing is 9 sections with a total length of 56.1 kilometers. The Olympic section is only a part, about 4.2 kilometers, and the actual opening is 3.6 kilometers. One kilometer of subway in Beijing costs about $150 million.",2022-03-02
The fact is 3.9 billion is only for the Olympic. ,2022-03-02
That's basically an entire nation's budget right there,2022-03-02
"Please release the original interview with the expert, it is obvious for the trainline part he was cut off. The trainline and train as he said was a part of local project that will be built with or without the game. Beijing is crowded enough and the city expansion to outer cities is ongoing.",2022-03-02
"I see very little fact finding has gone into this video, so let me explain why the 3.9 billion official figure is not as ridiculous as everyone thinks. ",2022-03-02
"If there is one country that don't make a loss out of an Olympics that would be China. They have the human capacity and also well thought out plans for whatever infrastructure they built for it. Instead of treating the infrastructure as ""only for the Olympics"" they would have definitely thought about what it will become after the Olympics, especially transport infrastructure. All the 2008 Beijing Olympics structures built are well kept and and in use till this day for example the birds nest. So I don't think its really fair to compare everyone the same way. Olympics has always been expensive, therefore well thought out planning is needed for every country if they want to host it.",2022-03-02
"Even the used extra water was mentioned, the reporters did not know there is a nation wide water infrastructure project started ten years ago and now completed to channel extra water across thousands of Miles from south west... For 10years not a single HSR was added to California",2022-03-02

"As an old fan of yours, I want to say that YOU CAN ALWAYS TRUST THE FOOD IN CHINA, espiecally in the event held by the official! In fact, there were more than 900 dishes (70% are western foods and 30% are Chinese foods) with a 24-hour supply in 2008 Beijing Olympics. The dishes repeated every 8 days, and there is a track system that tracked the ingredients' orgins for up to two years to ensure their safety and taste. You should know that China always greets foreign guests with the highest standards and the Chinese people really take meal seriously, though it's hard for you guys to find out the truth that covered by the western media.",2022-03-02
