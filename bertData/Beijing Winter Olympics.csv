Hope you can show us more from your time there in Beijing. Would love to know your activities and your experience there. Good luck hope you do well in the Games.,2022-03-02

"Wow! so well picked pictures! well picked video! all focus on fences and cages! haha, I can be a reporter too. You have your right to live with the virus, why others don't have the right to choose not to live with the virus. It's cultural differences. you don't need to demonise others when they don't want to do the same thing as yours.",2022-03-02
Beijing winter Olympic Games - Go! Go! Go!,2022-03-02
It always amazes me how y'all turn the positive facts into negative narrations,2022-03-02
Looking forward to see the Beijing Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.,2022-03-02
The world's biggest sporting event is suppose to unite people and bringing the world closer. ,2022-03-02
"I've seen different stories from here, as well as a lot of video clips shared by other athletes themselves, who are enjoying themselves in Beijing right now.  A balance needs to be found to protect local residents and international athletes from virus. Robotic restaurants and self-driving cars are coming as solutions.",2022-03-02
"This journalist is not only got a blind eye, but also got blind heart.",2022-03-02
"You like it, you don't like it, I am sure 99.9% of the participating athletes will be enjoying the game.......",2022-03-02
"Despite fake news and hate from the west, China remains focused on hosting a successful Winter Olympics. It seems unstoppable. That's an attitude that I admire to be honest.",2022-03-02
Can't wait for ice hockey ,2022-03-02
What I can see is well organized national event. They tried their best to serve the athletes and make sure to minimize the virus spread. No other countries can control the virus better than China. Love to see western media use every possible way to turn all these positive things into negative narrations.,2022-03-02
I am okay with different opinions.   But WP's criticism as such with clearly from a biased standpoint is really disgusting......,2022-03-02
it is interesting to see how WP spread sad mood through this ‚Äúinterview‚Äù,2022-03-02
"When I see ""Washington Post"" I pretty much sure what's in it.",2022-03-02
"I live in China. I was hoping for something actually about the athletes. We already know it's in a bubble, it's not news. I'm sure China will pull off a masterful job of hosting, but no one is talking about the competition and the athletes.",2022-03-02
WP literally made a lot of efforts in selecting the pictures but not in good journalism,2022-03-02
"Human being need peace no wars, this is the why we need olympics",2022-03-02
I am excited to watch all games in Beijing Olympic! Thank you Beijing for wonderful preparing and present such wonderful game to the world! That is spirit of Olympic!,2022-03-02
You guys forgot to mention that participants are allowed to go and spectate other events since they are in a bubble and they set up a high speed rail network for them to travel around the venues.  This was something that wasn‚Äôt even available in the Tokyo games but yours Deliberately left that out and try to make it sound like it‚Äôs a controlled game. Trying to demonise china once again.,2022-03-02
"The weather is very dry in the Beijing area and there is snowfall but not much, this  includes the mountains where the olympics are being held. So it is not a matter of occasional using snow machines, but needing vast amounts of snow making. ",2022-01-31
"They looked at 16 previous games, they found environmental, social, and economic sustainability generally trended downwards over time.",2022-01-31
It's more a sign than there is already a disaster happening in the environment worldwide.,2022-01-31
I'm old enough to remember when we used to have real snow.,2022-03-02
"Chose places that already have most of the facilities available (then that excludes poorer countries that could do with more infrastructure). Even then, there are eplenty of abandoned sites. It was great competing at Sydney Olympic Park's athletics track and aquatic centre after the games, plus most of the facilities are still in use!",2022-01-31
"In North America, winter resorts always generate tons if snow every year. Every country that hosted winter Olympics also generated snow. They are collectively doing something to environment if that is the case. I still think it does not have much adverse affect on the environment.",2022-01-31
"as IOC website said, ""All venues will be powered by renewable energy for the first time at the Olympic Games."" in Beijing 2022",2022-03-02
Questions to ask: How does the winter look like in this region in the year before 2015 (the time Beijing was picked to host the game). were they always this dry and no snow as well?,2022-01-31
They should pick one or two countries that they‚Äôve already built in and use that for where they host the Olympics so that they don‚Äôt have to keep building. They‚Äôve already done enough damage as is,2022-01-31
The next World Cup would be in Quatar where there would be an air-condition in the stadium!,2022-01-31
"Same thing happened during the Vancouver Olympics. We literally had to truck in new snow. However I don't remember anyone ever calling it a ""disaster for the environment"".",2022-01-31
A Winter Olympic cannot be called Winter Olympic without Winter.,2022-03-02
Interesting why you say this about China and you don‚Äôt say it about thousands of other ski hills around the world that do the same.,2022-01-31
gotta say that is pretty amazing feat,2022-03-02
"This comforts me because it shows China doesn't have access to weather machines as they would have used it to make it snow so their winter olympics would be ""the best ever"".",2022-01-31
"We've been doing this at ski resorts worldwide... Never did we not, because of the environment",2022-01-31
"I don't care about the Olympics, since the viewing rights are not freely available in my country, but rather tied up in expensive exclusive license agreements.",2022-01-31
This situation has happened in traditional skiing countries many times in last 50 years.,2022-01-31
Using snow making machines is common in ski resorts... but not on this scale. It's on a nature reserve and this area rarely receives snow. Compare this to games held in Utah... they actually receive real snow in the winter.,2022-01-31
This is BSB reporter. I'm here inside the Beijing Olympics Village. This is the village where American athletes will be staying.  I am here with the Manager of the Village Planner Officer.,2022-03-02

"Wow. you guys are genius, can turn everything into politics, please tell us something how native Indians were genocided from America.",2022-03-02
It's great opening ceremony!,2022-03-02
"Whoever built china olympic 2022 opening cermony, they're so creative",2022-03-02
Extraordinary and meaningful opening,2022-03-02
"It's beautiful and the host country should be very proud. It's sad that people in this country and the west still have the audacity to throw accusations about how the host country manages their own affairs with a complete disregard of what happened in this country and the world (the death from the pandemic, crimes & violence plus guns, racial bias, poverty & homelessness , and the millions of Muslim killed  or forced to be refugees in Iraq, Afghanistan and the mid east caused by these pathetic wars).",2022-03-02
"The boycott countries sent the most athletes to China. Out of 272 western reports on Beijing game.212 is related to human rights concern. Media manipulation is a series of related techniques in which partisans create an image or argument that favours their particular interests. Such tactics may include the use of logical fallacies, manipulation, outright deception(disinformation), rhetorical and propaganda techniques, and often involve the suppression of information or points of view by crowding them out, by inducing other people or groups of people to stop listening to certain arguments, or by simply diverting attention elsewhere.",2022-03-02
The US and west can get so low so as to politicise even a global friendly event like olympics..,2022-03-02

"The world is not made up of a few countries who want to politicise the games. They just show their small minds, including the presenters of this program.",2022-03-02
"The logic is weird. Do a normal person feel justified to checkout their neighborhood‚Äôs bedroom when they don‚Äôt want to show?  And when the neighbors want to show friendly,  they chooses not to see and think that‚Äôs fake?  Well,  even if I had a suspicious neighbor,  I would keep my mouth shut, pretend people are just friendly and let the authorities to do their work.",2022-03-02

Chinese brands and the digital yuan gain massive international publicity during the winter Olympics.  Repressive political boycott action is making most global brands unhappy as they accelerate loss of international market share. ,2022-03-02

"As a student volunteer, i had the honor to participate all the process of Beijing 2008 Olympic. I was there for the opening ceremony, and my classmates and I were so moved that we cried together. I was in charge of traffic control at the basketball arena throughout the basketball game and got to meet all the big international players in person.

"If you can understand madarian you will amaze even more on what Lang Ping's coaching... Probably due to her own player experience, she did not fuzz or blame the players at all at any time.  instead, she always gave a very specific instructions (e.g., which opponent player had what habit or what was the next attack she preferred her team to do).  She picked and trained every player by herself so her players were so confident with her.   Absolutely the best volleyball coach in decades!!!",2020-12-27
"As a person learning mandarin (5th year learning it), Lang Ping's coaching is pretty amazing. She doesn't blame them for possible mistakes they made, juts gives them instructions and coaching to make them even better. I love her!!",2021-12-27
"Lan Ping is simply amazing as a coach. She knew how to deal with these young ladies, plus the fact that she's really wise and strategic. So deserved!",2020-12-27
"Looking back here, Zhu shows no fear. I think it is because she's really young at this time so her condition was fresh and eager to contibute just like the opponent's Boskovic. The difference is that Zhu was more stable and controls her error (almost no error).",2021-12-27
Lang Ping just announced her retirement as a coach after Tokyo Olympics. What an overwhelming experience as a player and a coach truly one of the best in the world!,2020-12-27
It's so sad to see that the commentator is like that... I mean come on! As a person from Serbia I too did want Serbia to win but bro! I didn't say anything bad to the other team. I even cheered for them too! ,2021-12-27
I love Serbian team and especially Tijana Bo≈°koviƒá. This was a great match and Chinese team really deserved it. Respect both teams. ,2020-12-27

"In my younger days, I never had an eye on the volleyball game not until I accidentally watched China women volleyball match first with Brazil, Nevertheland and finally with Serbia for Olympic Championship in Reo.

"For those of you that saying Boskovic is better, look at how many unforced errors she made in this match! Zhu is so consistent and strong, very rarely makes errors, which is why she deserves to be the top paid volleyball player ever!",2020-12-27
"I've been watching this match for couple of times and still feel the passions and excitement. Today I just notice #6 GONG, the youngest player, was substituted-in in set #3 and #4 for the last minutes, she even did not touched the ball once and got the gold medal. Wow! And in the previous match with the Netherlands, she was also substituted by the end of the match, she spiked and got the second last point that time.

"Amazing!!!! All those actors, dancers, and athletes are an inspiration. Also, de participation of Stephen Hawking,¬†with a message of hope , constant struggle in life... BEAUTIFUL!!!",2015-12-29
The closing ceremony was AWESOME,2012-12-29

"Thats what I mean. The olympics opening ceremony was clearly done on a bigger budget, however this one actually told a story and brought out real emotions. It was hard not to have a lump in ya throat while watching this. It showed that you don't need to go all out there with money, fireworks and so on, you just need a good form of story telling and put real heart into it.",2012-12-29
"The Directors want to so proud of themselves, They put on a magnificent show, Personally much more touching and better than Boyle's Ceremony.",2012-12-29
The national anthem was absolutely beautiful. <3,2012-12-29
The fact they actually came through and built all of this infrastructure and villages in time boogles my mind.,2022-03-02
I pray that they actually use the villages after the games. There are so many Olympic villages that just sit and rot for no good reason.,2022-03-02
"Business Insider is like ""can you believe it, these games aren't going to make a profit. I can't believe it""",2022-03-02
Public infrastructure isn‚Äôt supposed to generate profits.,2022-03-02
There are tons of videos right here on Youtube about WHY Olympics are so expensive and a lot of it has nothing to do with the host nation. The standards set by the Olympic committee are sometimes absurd. Beijing is no difference in this regard.,2022-03-02
"Beijing is a large city with a population of 21 million. It is of great commercial value to build a professional ski resort in the surrounding area. There are originally many commercial ski resorts around Beijing, but I think having a more professional and larger ski resort is what most Chinese people would like to see. I live in Tianjin, a city very close to Beijing (30 minutes by high-speed train). I personally would love to go skiing at this ski resort on weekends.",2022-03-02
"Throughline did an amazing podcast on the costs of the Olympic Games. Worth a listen. It‚Äôs not just China, the Olympic committee is just trying to greenwash it imo due to all of the recent scrutiny",2022-03-02
"For China, hosting the Olympics is like a car company racing cars ‚Äî testing your latest technology and then applying it to other models",2022-03-02
"The stock market is still a fantastic tool for building wealth, however, so it's wise to consider investing even if you don't have much money to spare",2022-06-30
"Yep, China did build one line for the vunue commute, but it is not a fresh investment from ground zero. They just added one branch line to the massive domestic 40,000 km high speed railway network.",2022-03-02
"I think the one who was responsible for producing such a  ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù analysis might have forgotten about the infrastructures that would be transcend the sport and would be used way long after the games ended by locals. And I‚Äôm pretty sure, if Beijing didn‚Äôt live up to it‚Äôs promise and underspent and therefore would build poor infrastructure, it definitely would trigger Business Insiders to produce another ‚Äúshow‚Äù probably called ‚ÄúBeijing‚Äôs cheap olympics‚Äù ",2022-11-27
The big air is a permanent structure that was built for the world championship in 2019.,2022-03-02
"The budget for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games is US $1.56 billion, with 6% government subsidy. Most of the venues use the venues of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Infrastructure such as railways will be built even without the Olympic Games, which cannot be counted as the cost of the Olympic Games.",2022-03-02
"Beijing's 2021 gdp is 633 million US dollars. In 2021, the number of subways opened in Beijing is 9 sections with a total length of 56.1 kilometers. The Olympic section is only a part, about 4.2 kilometers, and the actual opening is 3.6 kilometers. One kilometer of subway in Beijing costs about $150 million.",2022-03-02
The fact is 3.9 billion is only for the Olympic. ,2022-03-02
That's basically an entire nation's budget right there,2022-03-02
"Please release the original interview with the expert, it is obvious for the trainline part he was cut off. The trainline and train as he said was a part of local project that will be built with or without the game. Beijing is crowded enough and the city expansion to outer cities is ongoing.",2022-03-02
"I see very little fact finding has gone into this video, so let me explain why the 3.9 billion official figure is not as ridiculous as everyone thinks. ",2022-03-02
"If there is one country that don't make a loss out of an Olympics that would be China. They have the human capacity and also well thought out plans for whatever infrastructure they built for it. Instead of treating the infrastructure as ""only for the Olympics"" they would have definitely thought about what it will become after the Olympics, especially transport infrastructure. All the 2008 Beijing Olympics structures built are well kept and and in use till this day for example the birds nest. So I don't think its really fair to compare everyone the same way. Olympics has always been expensive, therefore well thought out planning is needed for every country if they want to host it.",2022-03-02
"Even the used extra water was mentioned, the reporters did not know there is a nation wide water infrastructure project started ten years ago and now completed to channel extra water across thousands of Miles from south west... For 10years not a single HSR was added to California",2022-03-02
"Thank you for sharing, I sat up all night in Australia waiting for the Opening Ceremony. It was amazing, loved it!",2022-03-02
"As an old fan of yours, I want to say that YOU CAN ALWAYS TRUST THE FOOD IN CHINA, espiecally in the event held by the official! In fact, there were more than 900 dishes (70% are western foods and 30% are Chinese foods) with a 24-hour supply in 2008 Beijing Olympics. The dishes repeated every 8 days, and there is a track system that tracked the ingredients' orgins for up to two years to ensure their safety and taste. You should know that China always greets foreign guests with the highest standards and the Chinese people really take meal seriously, though it's hard for you guys to find out the truth that covered by the western media.",2022-03-02
The real show is completely different from what the US media is describing ,2022-03-02
Thanks for bringing us this close to Olympics! Love your positive attitude!,2022-03-02
We appreciate the effort! Thanks guys and stay warm! :),2022-03-02
"Really love the scene in which you guys holding big bowl of hot noodles n talking about all sorts of AI supported self-services in Olympic Village n then along with your narration it naturally pops up those on-site pictures, so cute, this kinda scenario arrangement makes me think of the way of story telling in cartoon pictures/movies.",2022-03-02
"Loving your Olympics videos, hoping you've got a few more lined up as well! ",2022-03-02
I loved your videos. Thanks for making the world a better place! Thanks for making a difference!,2022-03-02
I would‚Äôve loved to be a volunteer there as it was extremely difficult to get tickets to see the games in London (I was a volunteer there as well),2022-03-02
Sometimes the best things in life are when things dont go as planned,2022-03-02

Glad you got to watch the opening ceremony at least. Good job capturing that kiss! ,2022-03-02
There's nothing more enjoyable than a big bowl of hot noodles in winter. Love from Shanghai,2022-03-02
You guys and the Olympic Park were so near and yet so far. But your fun time with your new neighbour Amy in the pub made up for the disappointment. :D,2022-03-02
