0,For many many years I have been a great believer it traditional Chinese medicine. Not just acupuncture. If it's been going for 3000 years there must be something to it. I had eczema on my leg and tried all the creams my doctor prescribed to no avail. Then I tried a Chinese remedy. It disappeared completely within a week and has not come back. That was eight years ago.,4,neutral,0.8058755993843079,0.010365576483309269,0.01949499174952507,0.006702776532620192,0.002411175286397338,0.8058755993843079,0.030667854472994804,0.12448196858167648,2016-12-31

You also point out 2 different features such as the art is all your patient not only by this disease, the second is ego in western medicine may keep the patient far away to them, we can be lost the physical interaction and mindful connection to them so many cases can't cure efficiently.

I had terrible asthma attacks 2 years ago after I quit smoking.I didn't have an inhaler prescribed though as the doctors initially underestimated how serious the issue was at the time. I was taught the lung meridians and other acupressure points and I massaged them immediately when the attacks would set on and they would dissipate rapidly. It saved my life. If I hadn't known acupressure and very basic herbology I might not be alive.,6,surprise,0.5361583828926086,0.03446550294756889,0.07958153635263443,0.25414806604385376,0.002874133875593543,0.061858199536800385,0.030914198607206345,0.5361583828926086,2016-12-31

From what I've read of conventional western medical treatment of urticaria, they would have him on daily Zyrtec pills. In a few years it would fail, then he would take monthly Xolair shots, then that would fail and he would end up in ER and given Prednisone steroid shots, but that would eventually fail too. I'm so glad we tried TCM.

I had terrible asthma attacks 2 years ago after I quit smoking.I didn't have an inhaler prescribed though as the doctors initially underestimated how serious the issue was at the time. I was taught the lung meridians and other acupressure points and I massaged them immediately when the attacks would set on and they would dissipate rapidly. It saved my life.

From what I've read of conventional western medical treatment of urticaria, they would have him on daily Zyrtec pills. In a few years it would fail, then he would take monthly Xolair shots, then that would fail and he would end up in ER and given Prednisone steroid shots, but that would eventually fail too. I'm so glad we tried TCM.

From what I've read of conventional western medical treatment of urticaria, they would have him on daily Zyrtec pills. In a few years it would fail, then he would take monthly Xolair shots, then that would fail and he would end up in ER and given Prednisone steroid shots, but that would eventually fail too. I'm so glad we tried TCM.

1829,"Was always interested in TCM but can never find any good resources to learn it online for free, like what they'd teach you in this store. Although I don't believe in a lot of what TCM offers for its foundational working such as the existence of Chi, I do believe that the 1000s of year of research into various herbs and spices and their combination / application can remedy all kinds of diseases and disorders with little to no side effect that modern medicine doesn't offer. The application and knowledge really needs to be combined into modern medicine so that instead of relying solely on extremely expensive synthetic drugs, more research can be put into TCM with a combination of modern medical practices and some drugs.",4,neutral,0.931527853012085,0.007061616517603397,0.006730897817760706,0.0032490971498191357,0.010012240149080753,0.931527853012085,0.009968692436814308,0.03144965320825577,2020-12-30
