For many many years I have been a great believer it traditional Chinese medicine. Not just acupuncture. If it's been going for 3000 years there must be something to it. I had eczema on my leg and tried all the creams my doctor prescribed to no avail. Then I tried a Chinese remedy. It disappeared completely within a week and has not come back. That was eight years ago.,2016-12-28
"Thank you, Charmian! I have to say that this is one of the best motivational ted talks I have seen. You had to choose the majority in traditional medicine it's definitely a tough choice on this day in Western, you don't care about the other assessment, critics, you see the power of Traditional medicine and you protect ít and bring the pure quality to treatment. You also point out 2 different features such as the art is all your patient not only by this disease, the second is ego in western medicine may keep the patient far away to them, we can be lost the physical interaction and mindful connection to them so many cases can't cure efficiently. Thank you! Good luck!",2021-12-27

"She actually has a quite accurate description of what ""Qi"" really means. No, it's not an energy, nor a field, nor a force. It is perhaps at best described as a pattern. One analogy would be with economy. There isn't a physical thing that constitutes economic boom or recession, but a pattern of the entire system.",2018-12-28

"My nephew's urticaria was 100% cured by TCM(Tradtional Chinese Medicine). He's been cured of it for 3 years now. From what I've read of conventional western medical treatment of urticaria, they would have him on daily Zyrtec pills. In a few years it would fail, then he would take monthly Xolair shots, then that would fail and he would end up in ER and given Prednisone steroid shots, but that would eventually fail too. I'm so glad we tried TCM. It only took two months and only $170 with TCM.",2022-05-31

Can we also take a moment to emphasize that placebo is a powerful example of the power of the mind and healing the body? It’s interesting how western science just totally overlooks that.,2022-07-30
"The biggest evidence for the effectiveness of Chinese medicine that anybody can observe I think is that the country with the biggest population whether now or in ancient times relies on this medical system for the most of its history. If it doesn't work, there wouldn't be so many people then. It's a system based on 3000 years of experience. Some rationale is there and working even the current science can't explain for now. And I think one reason for the lack of CURRENT science base of Chinese medicine is the lack of interest and real research which costs.",2016-12-28

Amazing how so many say it's bullshit that have never tried it. I had terrible asthma attacks 2 years ago after I quit smoking.I didn't have an inhaler prescribed though as the doctors initially underestimated how serious the issue was at the time. I was taught the lung meridians and other acupressure points and I massaged them immediately when the attacks would set on and they would dissipate rapidly. It saved my life. If I hadn't known acupressure and very basic herbology I might not be alive.,2016-12-28

"Was always interested in TCM but can never find any good resources to learn it online for free, like what they'd teach you in this store. Although I don't believe in a lot of what TCM offers for its foundational working such as the existence of Chi, I do believe that the 1000s of year of research into various herbs and spices and their combination / application can remedy all kinds of diseases and disorders with little to no side effect that modern medicine doesn't offer. The application and knowledge really needs to be combined into modern medicine so that instead of relying solely on extremely expensive synthetic drugs, more research can be put into TCM with a combination of modern medical practices and some drugs.",2020-12-27

The Medicinal aspect of Chinese culture is quite health conscious. It’s a very fascinating contrast.

"Very cool. I had my own profound experiences of acupuncture over forty years ago. Now I do my humble best to share with others what I've learned. I recommend everyone study and practice chi-kung,  not just for eight months, but every day for life. It is beneficial for all ailments, but the patient must practice chi-kung as well. It is as close to a panacea as you will ever find. The patient must take an active interest in not continuing those bad habits which cause an imbalance of the chi in the first place. Find balance in your life and be well.",2022-11-27
"I had 10 sessions of acupuncture to release and heal a frozen shoulder and I did not feel any pain at all when the needles went in. There was a tingling sensation but it was not pain. There was only one point, by my knee, that I had to ask for the needle to be removed. It was not painful but the sensation was very unpleasant. The doctor agreed that it was a very 'strong' point and she removed the needle for me. The rest of the points were in the hand, arm and upper back and they were no problem at all. She also gave me a brisk massage with a special alcohol rub with herbs in and I had to take some herbal pills for a few weeks. The treatment cured the problem.",2022-09-28

"It’s a female complaint, but your husband has to take it, too! Wow that’s an interesting diagnosis, like uti from std. He was very discreet.

I appreciate both approaches now that I’m ready to learn more about healing. Thanks to YouTube creators like this one.",2022-08-29
