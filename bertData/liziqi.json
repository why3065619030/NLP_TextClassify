Her MCN makes huge money in China selling Liziqi brand merchandises, but Liziqi did not get much because of her lack of experience when she signed those contracts. That’s why she stopped creating new content to protest. Hopefully this whole thing can be settled in her favour and she can get her name brand back.",

At the very beginning, when ancient poets and writers were having a picnic, they sat on the bank of a beautiful creek, reciting poems and reading books aloud. When everyone talks about being happy, they put the wine glass in the water, and the wine glass drifts slowly with the flow of water. When the wine glass stops at someone's position, he will drink the wine and read a poem aloud, winning everyone's applause and admiration. Often these poets will make beautiful poems on the spot because of the beautiful scenery and happy mood after drinking. But when it rains, there is no way to hold these gatherings in the wild, so they made this kind of table imitating the environment of the creek, chanting poetry and gathering indoors. Later, these habits gradually diversified. It can also be that everyone sits together and chats and drinks tea, tastes pure natural food, enjoys the gifts of nature, and praises the greatness and love of the Creator. Japan also retains these traditions.  At the end of the video, Li Ziqi recites an ancient poem, the general idea is as follows: when we are most proud of our lives, we must sing and dance to our heart's content, and don't let the beautiful wine glasses be without wine. Under the moonlight, the transparent luminous wine glass is always full of amber wine, which can be enjoyed at any time. On such a beautiful night, the moon will praise you for good wine and your happiness.",

At the very beginning, when ancient poets and writers were having a picnic, they sat on the bank of a beautiful creek, reciting poems and reading books aloud. When everyone talks about being happy, they put the wine glass in the water, and the wine glass drifts slowly with the flow of water. When the wine glass stops at someone's position, he will drink the wine and read a poem aloud, winning everyone's applause and admiration. Often these poets will make beautiful poems on the spot because of the beautiful scenery and happy mood after drinking. But when it rains, there is no way to hold these gatherings in the wild, so they made this kind of table imitating the environment of the creek, chanting poetry and gathering indoors. Later, these habits gradually diversified. It can also be that everyone sits together and chats and drinks tea, tastes pure natural food, enjoys the gifts of nature, and praises the greatness and love of the Creator. Japan also retains these traditions.  At the end of the video, Li Ziqi recites an ancient poem, the general idea is as follows: when we are most proud of our lives, we must sing and dance to our heart's content, and don't let the beautiful wine glasses be without wine. Under the moonlight, the transparent luminous wine glass is always full of amber wine, which can be enjoyed at any time. On such a beautiful night, the moon will praise you for good wine and your happiness.",

I was playing in the fields with my friends, herding cattle and playing games in the mountains. The happiness at that time was very simple. When harvesting rice in the summer, I was exposed to the big sun. Although I was reluctant, I would also participate in labor. My parents would reward me for eating watermelon and popsicles. In the evening, I met my friends to watch local dramas under the moonlight. Everything is beautiful and carefree. Last year, due to the epidemic, I experienced many farming tasks at home, including planting rice seedlings, harvesting, and planting peanuts.",

Even tho you didnt upload any new videos, I'm rewatching your old ones during my 5 mins breaks. It brought back nostalgia and bring me some new motivation to continue going. Your videos constantly reminded me of my old self that have sacrificed a great effort for me to come this far. Which is why i should not give up no matter hard or scary it is.",

Her simply stylized scenes & food presentation, was not limited by her use of cell phone camera or editing - her imagination & hard work spelled genius well into every video she has published to the present day in mid-June 2020! Bravo to Liziqi. Looking forward to more of her visual tales of her lives + her singing!",
